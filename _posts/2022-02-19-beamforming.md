# Beamforming in Acoustic/Audio Engineering Intro

- mainly being used for RADAR, SONAR, smart antenna in mobile communication system.
- Beamforming technology is also used with microphone array in the audio field. 

<br>

what is Beamforming in acoustics?
---

- Beamforming is the process of forming the directional and spatial response with microphone array. It calculates the time delay, phase shift and coherent summation with the wave arrived at the microhpone array. Eventually, it enable to identify the position of the sound source and other characteristics as well.<br><br> It is also one of acoustic array techniques. NearField Acoustic Holography is also a part of this techniques. 
<br>
<br>

There are several typical models used for beamforming, for example,

- Near Field Beamformer
- adaptive beamformer
- Delay and Sum Beamformer (Conventional)
- Frost Beamformer

The main benefit of beamforming
- enable to enhance the signal from one specific direction while minimizing the signal from other direcitons. Also by using multiple numbers of microhpne - mircrophone array, it can improve the SNR and localization performance.
